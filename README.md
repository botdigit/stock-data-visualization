# stock-data-visualization

       Some parts of the program are currently not in working state due to shutdown of yahoo chart API by yahoo finance, we are working on this   problem and new version of this program will be available by august end . we do respect your patience
         
The main objective of this program is to create a visualization of stock market data data and the main  source of raw stock market data that we use here is "yahoo chart API". Our  main focus in this program is to  visualize three entites , that are  MACD, Stock price and volume, RSI


The machine learning part of the project is good and in working condition , you can use it efficently 

to run the machine learning program just copy or clone the linear_regression.py file and run it from terminal using python command 


eg:      $ python3 linear_regression.py
